Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

To install one model, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install one_model

This is the preferred method to install one model, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

From sources
------------

The sources for one model can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/audreyr/one_model

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -OJL https://github.com/audreyr/one_model/tarball/master
